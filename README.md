# Random Picker

Need to choose between a couple of people? Use this random generator. Just run:

``` Ruby
ruby picker.rb name1 name2
```

And it will do the rest, outputting a blow-by-blow of the 200 times it generates a truly random choice between the names input on the line. If you're going to do a larger group, you might want to increase the times it is run. In case of a tie, you can re-run it against those names.
